Hi Peter,

I am curious about this project. I also got the same water meter. I am not sure how the HRI is connected to the wemos.
Is it connected directly? What about the voltage on D7? What kind of shield is the right one in this picture:

I could not find any other way to contact you, so I tried it this way.

Best regards
Goran
